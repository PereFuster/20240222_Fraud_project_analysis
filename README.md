The delivery are rules to find disputers and apply them. Regarding other things, I am not aligned and I am not updated. 
What we are doing for the rules, it is a mix of business logic with some other research. 


# Find rules

Rules are a series of indications that can cover a group of users to have certain risks. 
Rules ideally cover as much users as possible and detect as higher dispute rates as possible. 


# Problem particularities

- Small dispute rates: We have to obtain high probabilities for very uncomon types of users. 

- Concentration of paid amount and amount disputed in a very very few users: If you can conver this then you're done. You can play with some groups of high payers. 

- Users life time: You need to build rules that take into account where users are at in their lifetime value. You can play with some segments and get the learnings, then you
  can optimise the rule numbers for each group. 

- Complexity relatively to data flexibility - We need to go piece by piece and spend time on things that do not generate any result. 

- Rules shape - We want rules and we do not care if they overlap. 


# Next step 

* Analyse hypotheses
* Understand key factors and test out combinations to find disputers
