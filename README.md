# Fraud_project_analysis



This project is about finding groups on user on which trying investigate further to prevent fraud payments from occurring. 

First conversation with Leo, says that there are two people working on this that I need to catch up with in terms of finding a solution. 

Furthermore, I need to catch up with Yang and Lu in order to be able to be able to load the data directly from our system. 


Problem statement: It seems its about finding an approach to rank users, or payments. Give them as score, to then
be able to utilise different techiniques. Furthermore, we discuss the concept of fraud, which is not clear. Is it anytime a payment is 
not materialised in app revenue?
